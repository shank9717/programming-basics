Factory method is used to create objects using a 
factory class. The factory class is tasked with creation
of the complete object based on user needs.

In the example given here, we want to create apps
for either Android OS or Apple IOS mobiles. 

We create AndroidApp/IOSApp, and also create factory
classes AndroidFactory and IOSFactory. These
factory classes in-turn handle creation of the apps
for the corresponding mobile type.
