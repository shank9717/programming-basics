# Introduction to the most popular searching algorithms

1. Linear Search
   
Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm that goes through all elements one by one to look for a match. Works in both unsorted and sorted datasets.

**Time Complexity:** O(N)

2. Binary Search
 
Binary Search is a searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It splits the array at the mid point and chooses one half of the array to work with and discards the other half.

**Time Complexity**: O(N LogN)
